# ChoroplethMapping
Practicing some basic map skills

I created a basic choropleth map using folium and the Oregon Health Authority's open data on 
vaccination (https://visual-data.dhsoha.state.or.us/t/OHA/views/OregonCOVID-19VaccinationTrends-SummaryTable/OregonCOVID-19VaccineProviderEnrollmentSummaryTable?:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link&:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y)

I also created a precinct level map of Multnomah County showing the percentage of the vote Biden won in each precinct:

I am not even remotely knowledgeable about anything GIS, so I thought doing something fun and familiar like a politics related map would
be a good intro.
